Irreversible migrations are just that, irreversible. Do not apply irreversible migrations unless
your sure you know what you are doing. Once applied the migration cannot be reversed. In the event
that you apply a irreversible migration then later need to reverse that migration, or one applied
prior to it, you will have to manually edit your database, then use the set-head command to mark
the irreversible migration as unapplied.
