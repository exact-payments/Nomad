Nomad is a migration tool for working with any data store or data base. to
get started create a 'NomadFile.js' in the root of your project. You can do
with the 'nomad init' command. This will generate a 'NomadFile.js' file.

Once you have your 'NomadFile.js' generated you will need to add the appropriate
logic for each of the methods within the file.

To generate your first migration execute 'nomad create' in your terminal. Nomad
will ask you a few questions about your migration then it will create it in
the migrations folder. From here you can add the intended logic to the new
migration file. Don't forget to set the value of isReversible to 'true' or
'false'.

To run your new migration execute the command 'nomad up'. This will apply any
unapplied migrations in order of creation. If you want to migrate up to a
specific migration you can add the name or filename of the migration to the
end of the command; 'nomad up addSecondAddressToContact' or
'nomad up 20150908-132201-00-addSecondAddressToContact.js'.

Sometimes mistakes happen. To rollback a migration use 'nomad down
addSecondAddressToContact'. This will rollback all migrations back to and
including 'addSecondAddressToContact'.

To see what migrations have been applied use 'nomad log'. This will render a
table listing all migrations nomad knows about and their status.
