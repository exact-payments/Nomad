Nomad is a migration tool for working with any data store or data base. to
get started create a 'NomadFile.js' in the root of your project. You can do
with the 'nomad init' command. This will generate a 'NomadFile.js' file.

Once you have your 'NomadFile.js' generated you will need to add the appropriate
logic for each of the methods within the file.

To generate your first migration execute 'nomad create' in your terminal. Nomad
will ask you a few questions about your migration then it will create it in
the migrations folder. From here you can add the intended logic to the new
migration file. Don't forget to set the value of isReversible to 'true' or
'false'.
